One of [the primary goals for Immutant 2.x](/news/2014/04/02/the-deuce/)
was the removal of the ancient AS7 fork we lugged around in
Immutant 1.x. This eliminates the need to install and deploy your apps
into a "container" to use the Immutant libraries.

But here's the trade-off: app server containers can simplify the
configuration of features -- e.g. security, monitoring, clustering --
for all the applications deployed to it.

Further, each Immutant library automatically benefits from being
clustered. Without any changes to your code, deploying your app to
WildFly yields the following enhanced functionality:

* Web session replication
* Load-balanced message distribution
* Highly-available "singleton" scheduled jobs
* Flexible cache replication
* Multiple polyglot app deployments

So we wanted to *facilitate* app server deployment but not actually
*require* it. And we didn't want to require any tweaking of the stock
"vanilla" configuration provided by the app server. This meant using
the standard deployment protocol for all Java app servers: war files.

Theoretically, this implies you could stick the Immutant jars in any
ol' war file and deploy them to any ol' Java app server.
Unfortunately, Immutant's ability to work both outside and inside a
container requires some "glue code" that must be aware of the
container's implementation.

For this reason, Immutant intentionally uses the same services as
[WildFly], the community-supported upstream project for the *next*
version of the commercially-supported
[Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform] \(EAP) product.

If you are using the *current* version of EAP (6.4.x), everything here
applies, but you'll want to take a look at our
[EAP guide](guide-EAP.html) as well.

## WildFly

There are lots of resources for installing and administering WildFly,
and frankly, we love being able to refer you to those rather than
write them ourselves. :)

Thankfully, installing WildFly is trivial:

    $ wget http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/9.0.2.Final/wildfly-9.0.2.Final.zip
    $ unzip wildfly-9.0.2.Final.zip

Downloading and unpacking it somewhere are all there is to it. Running
it is easy, too:

    $ wildfly-9.0.2.Final/bin/standalone.sh

Pass it `-h` to see what options it supports. The main one you'll use
is `-c` which refers to one of its config files beneath
`standalone/configuration`. The default config doesn't include
HornetQ, for example, so to use `cloboss.messaging`, you'll need to
start WildFly as follows:

    $ wildfly-9.0.2.Final/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml

And if you want clustering...

    $ wildfly-9.0.2.Final/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml

You can create your own, of course, too.

## The lein-cloboss plugin

The [lein-cloboss] plugin was fundamental to developing apps for
Immutant 1.x. In 2.x, it's only required if you wish to deploy
your Clojure apps to WildFly, and its formerly numerous tasks have
been reduced to two: `cloboss war` and `cloboss test`. Add the
latest version to the `:plugins` section of your `project.clj` to
install it, e.g.

    :plugins [[lein-cloboss "2.1.0"]]

*Note:* If you are a [boot] user, we have a [boot-cloboss plugin]
as well.

### Creating a war file

Immutant war files require a bit of special config: a couple of jars
of the aforementioned "glue code", a properties file to trigger that
code, a couple of tags in `web.xml`, and a
`jboss-deployment-structure.xml` to link the deployment to the
necessary WildFly modules.  You'll find copies of the latter two files
beneath `target/` after you run the war task in your project, along
with an *uberjar* containing your app plus its dependencies, and
finally a war file packaging it all up together:

    $ lein cloboss war

The `cloboss war` task provides a number of configuration options,
all of which can be specified both in the `[:cloboss :war]` path of
`project.clj` and as command line arguments, with the latter taking
precedence.

For a detailed description of each option:

    $ lein help cloboss deployment

For a brief listing of just the command line switches:

    $ lein help cloboss war

### org.cloboss/wildfly

Automatically included in an Immutant war file is a library that makes
the [[cloboss.wildfly]] namespace available to your app. This
contains functions that are only relevant when your app is running in
the [WildFly] container. If your app relies on these functions and you
need to compile them outside the container, you must explicitly depend
on `org.cloboss/wildfly` in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
(defproject some-project "1.2.3"
  ...
  :dependencies [[org.cloboss/cloboss "{{version}}"]
                 [org.cloboss/wildfly "{{version}}"]]
```

### Running tests in-container

Although you no longer need to run a container to test your
applications' use of the Immutant libraries, it is still possible via
the `cloboss test` task.

    $ lein cloboss test -j /srv/wildfly

It will find all the tests (or [Midje] facts, or [Expectations]
expectations) in a project, fire up the [WildFly] instance installed
at `/srv/wildfly`, deploy the project to it, connect to its REPL, run
all the tests, undeploy the app, shutdown the WildFly process, and
display the results, returning success only if all tests pass.

Because it conveniently runs all your tests inside the app server, a
successful run yields a high confidence that your code will run
correctly when it counts â€“ in production, when deployed to the same
app server. For this reason, it may also be useful to run it on your
app's Continuous Integration host whenever any changes are committed.

The server config and log output for the WildFly instance used for the
test run can be found beneath your project's
`target/isolated-wildfly/` directory.

Similar to the `cloboss war` task, configuration of the `cloboss
test` task may be specified in either the `[:cloboss :test]` path of
`project.clj` or as command line arguments. For a detailed description
of each option:

    $ lein help cloboss testing

And for a brief listing of just the command line switches:

    $ lein help cloboss test

## Deploying to WildFly

Once you have a war file, it's a simple matter of making it known to
your WildFly server. The easiest way to do that is to copy it to a
directory that is monitored by WildFly for artifacts to deploy.
Assuming you installed WildFly in `/srv/wildfly`, that path is
`/srv/wildfly/standalone/deployments`. For example:

    $ lein cloboss war
    $ cp target/myapp.war /srv/wildfly/standalone/deployments

Alternatively,

    $ lein cloboss war -o /srv/wildfly

If not already running, fire up WildFly to see your deployed app:

    $ /srv/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml

## Running Ring Handlers in WildFly

When running inside WildFly, the `:host` and `:port` options to
`cloboss.web/run` are silently ignored since your handlers are
mounted on WildFly's internal Undertow server, bound to whatever
host/port it's been configured for.

Also, the URL for your handler will include a context path
corresponding to the base name of your deployed war file. This context
path will prefix whatever `:path` option you specified. To override
this and set your context path to "/" instead, name your war file
`ROOT.war`:

    $ lein cloboss war -o /srv/wildfly -n ROOT

## Initialization Caveats

There are two issues to be aware of with regards to application
initialization in WildFly:

* Your `:main` function *must* return when initialization is
  complete - deployment will not finish until it does. If it doesn't
  return within 4 minutes, the deployment will be aborted. If you need
  more than 4 minutes, you can override the default with
  `-Datticboss.deployment.timeout=<n seconds>`. Note that if you set
  that to more than 5 minutes, you will also need to increase
  WildFly's own coarser grained deployment timeout with
  `-Djboss.as.management.blocking.timeout=<m seconds>`.

* Any `cloboss.web/run` calls *have* to occur before `:main`
  returns. A limitation of the JavaEE specification prevents us from
  registering any servlets after that point.

## Logging in WildFly

To learn about how logging works when inside WildFly, along with how
to change the default configuration, see our [logging guide].

## Async Issues with WildFly 8.2

Due to
[a locking issue around sessions](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-3715),
HTTP streams have a couple of limitations in WildFly 8.2, namely:

* [[cloboss.web.async/send!]] calls to a stream are actually synchronous
  instead of asynchronous
* you cannot pass a `:timeout` to [[cloboss.web.async/as-channel]] -
  doing so will trigger an exception

We recommend you upgrade to WildFly 9.0.0 or newer if you intend to
use HTTP streams.

## Concurrent Requests When Using Sessions

In order to satisfy the JavaEE spec, WildFly serializes requests that
share a session. This means if you are using a session, you can't have
concurrent requests - requests will queue up waiting for the previous
request to complete. This includes asynchronous requests, which means
that a synchronous request may have to wait for a possibly
long-running async request to complete.

In order to prevent this, you'll have to adjust the caching settings
to allow concurrent access.

If using `standalone.xml` or `standalone-full.xml`, change the `web` cache container to:

    <cache-container name="web" default-cache="passivation" module="org.wildfly.clustering.web.infinispan">
      <local-cache name="passivation">
        <locking isolation="READ_COMMITTED"/>
        <transaction mode="BATCH"/>
        <file-store passivation="true" purge="false"/>
      </local-cache>

      <local-cache name="persistent">
        <locking isolation="READ_COMMITTED"/>
        <transaction mode="BATCH"/>
        <file-store passivation="false" purge="false"/>
      </local-cache>
    </cache-container>

Or, for `standalone-ha.xml` or `standalone-ha-full.xml`:

    <cache-container name="web" default-cache="repl" module="org.wildfly.clustering.web.infinispan">
      <transport lock-timeout="60000"/>
      <replicated-cache name="repl" mode="ASYNC" batching="true">
        <transaction locking="OPTIMISTIC"/>
        <locking isolation="READ_COMMITTED"/>
        <file-store/>
      </replicated-cache>
    </cache-container>
