[Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform](http://www.jboss.org/products/eap/overview/)
(EAP for short) is the commercial product built on the open source
JBoss application server. The current version (6.4.x) is based on a
JBoss AS version that predates WildFly, so has some component
differences with WildFly and Immutant itself. However, starting with
Immutant 2.1.0, you can now deploy Immutant applications to EAP the
same way you can to [WildFly](guide-wildfly.html), with some caveats.

## Messaging

EAP 6.4.x uses an older version of HornetQ (2.3.25 vs. 2.4.5 brought
in by Immutant). If you are using `org.cloboss/messaging`, you'll
need to exclude its version of HornetQ and bring in the version being
used in EAP:

    :exclusions [org.hornetq/hornetq-jms-server org.hornetq/hornetq-server]
    :dependencies [[org.hornetq/hornetq-jms-server "2.3.25.Final"]
                   [org.hornetq/hornetq-server "2.3.25.Final"]]


## Transactions

EAP 6.4.x uses a version of Narayana (4.17.29 vs. 5.0.3 brought in by
Immutant). If you are using `org.cloboss/transactions`, you'll need
to exclude its version of Narayana and bring in the version being used
in EAP (note the different groupId):

    :exclusions [org.jboss.narayana.jta/narayana-jta]
    :dependencies [[org.jboss.jbossts.jta/narayana-jta "4.17.29.Final"]]

If you are connecting external clients to the HornetQ inside EAP, you
must *not* set the `:remote-type` option to `:hornetq-wildfly` in the
options passed to [[cloboss.messaging/context]] and will need to set
the `:port` option to `5445` as EAP doesn't support WildFly's protocol
multiplexing over HTTP.

## Web

EAP 6.4.x uses [jbossweb](http://jbossweb.jboss.org/) as its
web/servlet server instead of [Undertow](http://undertow.io/) (which
Immutant uses standalone, and is the web/servlet server inside
WildFly). The behavior of web requests in EAP should be the same as
WildFly, but you'll need to do a couple of extra configuration steps
if you intend to use Websockets.

First, you need to change the configuration of EAP itself (in
`standalone/configuration/standalone*.xml`) to use a different
protocol in the web subsystem. To do so, change:

    <connector name="http" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="http" socket-binding="http"/>

to

    <connector name="http" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" scheme="http" socket-binding="http"/>


Second, you'll need to include a custom `jboss-web.xml` file in the
generated WAR file that enables Websockets for the deployment. The
file needs to be under `WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml`, and contain:

    <jboss-web>
      <enable-websockets>true</enable-websockets>
    </jboss-web>

The easiest way to do this is to use the
[`:war-resources` option of the `lein-cloboss` plugin](https://github.com/cloboss/lein-cloboss/blob/master/docs/deployment.md). Note
that a WAR with the above contents *can't* be deployed to a WildFly
server, as `enable-websockets` isn't a valid option there,
unfortunately.

## Caching

Immutant's caching library is designed to work with different major
versions of Infinispan, including 5, 6, 7 and 8. EAP 6.4 includes
Infinispan 5, which is relatively old with some known issues. Three
things, in particular:

* [IMMUTANT-454](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT-454) is not
  fixed in EAP 6.4
* Because it lacks support for `Equivalence` functions, binary keys are
  stored in wrappers, a common Infinispan technique prior to version 6.
  This limits your ability to read/write values in a cache with
  different encodings, which is something nobody should ever do
  anyway.
* Events are a little broken in Infinispan 5. Specifically, neither
  the `:pre?` nor `:value` attributes will change in the before and
  after events.

## Detecting EAP at runtime

If you need to detect if you are running inside EAP or not, in
addition to the [[cloboss.util/in-container?]] function to let you
know if you are in any container (WildFly or EAP), there is
[[cloboss.util/in-eap?]], which will only return `true` if you are
running inside EAP.

## Doing it all from a profile

If you want to only have these changes take effect when deploying to
EAP, you can put them all in a lein profile:

    :profiles {:eap
               {:exclusions [org.hornetq/hornetq-jms-server org.hornetq/hornetq-server
                             org.jboss.narayana.jta/narayana-jta]
                :dependencies [[org.hornetq/hornetq-jms-server "2.3.25.Final"]
                               [org.hornetq/hornetq-server "2.3.25.Final"]
                               [org.jboss.jbossts.jta/narayana-jta "4.17.29.Final"]]
                :cloboss {:war {:resource-paths ["eap-resources"]}}}}

where `eap-resources/` contains `WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml`. You would
then apply this profile only when building a WAR file for EAP:

    lein with-profile +eap cloboss war

For an example of an application that does this, see our
[feature demo](https://github.com/cloboss/feature-demo/).
