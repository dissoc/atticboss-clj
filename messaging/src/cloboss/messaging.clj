(defn ^Context context
  "Creates a messaging context.

   A context represents a remote or local connection to the messaging
   broker.

   There are three reasons you would create a context rather
   than rely on the messaging functions to lazily create them as
   needed:

   1. for communicating with a remote HornetQ instance
   2. for sharing a context among a batch of messaging operations
   3. for decoupling the client-id from the subscription name for
      durable topic subscriptions (see [[subscribe]])

   You are responsible for closing any contexts created via this
   function.

   Options that apply to both local and remote contexts are [default]:

   * :client-id - identifies the context for use with a durable topic
                  subscriber (see [[subscribe]]) [nil]
   * :xa?       - if true, returns an XA context for use in a
                  distributed transaction [false]
   * :mode      - one of: :auto-ack, :client-ack, :transacted. Ignored
                  if :xa? is true. [:auto-ack]

   Options that apply to only remote contexts are [default]:

   * :host - the host of a remote broker [nil]
   * :port - the port of a remote broker [nil, 5445 if :host provided]
   * :username - a username for the remote broker [nil]
   * :password - the corresponding password for :username [nil]
   * :remote-type - when connecting to a HornetQ instance running
                    inside WildFly, this needs to be set to
                    :hornetq-wildfly [:hornetq-standalone]
   * :reconnect-attempts - total number of reconnect attempts to make
                           before giving up (-1 for unlimited) [0]
   * :reconnect-retry-interval - the period in milliseconds between subsequent
                                 recontext attempts [2000]
   * :reconnect-max-retry-interval - the max retry interval that will be used [2000]
   * :reconnect-retry-interval-multiplier - a multiplier to apply to the time
                                            since the last retry to compute the
                                            time to the next retry [1.0]"

   Note the default :mode is :transacted. This can lead to deadlock
