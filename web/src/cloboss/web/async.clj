(defn send!
  "Send a message to the channel, asynchronously.

  `message` can either be a `String`, `File`, `InputStream`, `ISeq`,
  `byte[]`, or map. If it is a `String`, it will be encoded to the
  character set of the response for HTTP streams, and as UTF-8 for
  WebSockets. `File`s and `InputStream`s will be sent as up to 16k
  chunks (each chunk being a `byte[]` message for WebSockets). Each
  item in an `ISeq` will pass through `send!`, and can be any of the
  valid message types.

  If `message` is a map, its :body entry must be one of the other
  valid message types, and its :status and :headers entries will be
  used to override the status or headers returned from the handler
  that called `as-channel` for HTTP streams. A map is *only* a valid
  message on the first send to an HTTP stream channel - an exception
  is thrown if it is passed on a subsequent send or passed to a
  WebSocket channel.

  The following options are supported [default]:

   * :close? - if `true`, the channel will be closed when the send completes.
     Setting this to `true` on the first send to an HTTP stream channel
     will cause it to behave like a standard HTTP response, and *not* chunk
     the response. [false]
   * :on-success - `(fn [] ...)` - called when the send attempt has completed
     successfully. If this callback throws an exception, it will be
     reported to the [[as-channel]] :on-error callback [nil]
   * :on-error - `(fn [throwable] ...)` - Called when an error occurs on the send.
     If the error requires the channel to be closed, the [[as-channel]] :on-close
     callback will also be invoked. If this callback throws an exception, it will be
     reported to the [[as-channel]] :on-error callback [`#(throw %)`]

   Returns nil if the channel is closed when the send is initiated, true
   otherwise. If the channel is already closed, :on-success won't be
   invoked."

(defn as-channel
  "Converts the current ring `request` in to an asynchronous channel.

  The type of channel created depends on the request - if the request
  is a Websocket upgrade request (the :websocket? key is true), a
  Websocket channel will be created. Otherwise, an HTTP stream channel
  is created. You interact with both channel types using the other
  functions in this namespace, and through callbacks in `options`.

  The callbacks common to both channel types are:

  * :on-open - `(fn [ch] ...)` - called when the channel is
    available for sending. Will only be invoked once.
  * :on-error - `(fn [ch throwable] ...)` - Called for any error
    that occurs in relation to the channel. If the error
    requires the channel to be closed, :on-close will also be invoked.
    To handle [[send!]] errors separately, provide it a completion
    callback.
  * :on-close - `(fn [ch {:keys [code reason]}] ...)` -
    called for *any* close, including a call to [[close]], but will
    only be invoked once. `ch` will already be closed by the time
    this is invoked.

  `code` and `reason` will be the numeric closure code and text reason,
  respectively, if the channel is a WebSocket
  (see <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4>). Both will be nil
  for HTTP streams.

  If the channel is a Websocket, the following callback is also used:

  * :on-message - `(fn [ch message] ...)` - Called for each message
    from the client. `message` will be a `String` or `byte[]`

  You can also specify a `:timeout` option, that will cause a
  Websocket to be closed if *idle* more than the timeout, or an HTTP
  stream to be closed if *open* more than the timeout. This means that
  once opened, an HTTP stream will be closed after :timeout elapses,
  regardless of activity. It defaults to 0 (no timeout), and is in
  milliseconds.

  When the ring handler is called during a WebSocket upgrade request,
  any changes to the session in the response map are applied, and any
  headers from the response map are included in the upgrade response.

  Returns a ring response map, at least the :body of which *must* be
  returned in the response map from the calling ring handler."
