(defn schedule
  "Schedules a function to run according to a specification composed from any of the following:

  * [[in]] - a period after which f will be called
  * [[at]] - a time after which f will be called
  * [[every]] - the period between calls
  * [[until]] - stops the calls at a specific time
  * [[limit]] - limits the calls to a specific count
  * [[cron]] - calls f according to a [Quartz-style](http://quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.2.x/tutorials/tutorial-lesson-06) cron spec

  Units for periods are milliseconds, but can also be represented as a
  keyword or a sequence of multiplier/keyword pairs,
  e.g. `[1 :week, 4 :days, 2 :hours, 30 :minutes, 59 :seconds]`.
  See [[every]] for the list of valid period keywords.

  Time values can be a `java.util.Date`, a long denoting
  milliseconds-since-epoch, or a String in `HH:mm` format, interpreted
  as the next occurence of \"HH:mm:00\" in the currently active
  timezone.

  For example:

  ```
  (schedule #(prn 'fire!)
    (-> (in 5 :minutes)
      (every 2 :hours, 30 :minutes)
      (until \"1730\")))

  (schedule #(prn 'fire!)
    (-> (at some-date)
      (every :second)
      (limit 60)))
  ```

  Ultimately, the spec is just a map, and the syntactic sugar
  functions are just assoc'ing keys corresponding to their names. The
  map can be passed either explicitly or via keyword arguments. All of
  the following are equivalent:

  ```
  (schedule #(prn 'fire!) (-> (in 5 :minutes) (every :day)))
  (schedule #(prn 'fire!) {:in [5 :minutes], :every :day})
  (schedule #(prn 'fire!) :in [5 :minutes], :every :day)
  ```

  Three additional options may be passed in the spec:

  * :id - a unique identifier for the scheduled job
  * :singleton - denotes the job's behavior in a cluster. If truthy, an :id as required. The
    given value will be used as the :id if it is truthy but not `true` and :id isn't specified [false]
  * :allow-concurrent-exec? - a boolean denoting the job's concurrency behavior in the current process [true]

  If called with an :id that has already been scheduled, the prior job
  will be replaced. If an id is not provided, a UUID is used instead.

  If :allow-concurrent-exec? is true, a job that fires while a
  previous invocation is running will also run, assuming a worker
  thread is available.

  The return value is a map of the options with any missing defaults
  filled in, including a generated id if necessary.

  You can pass additional options that will be passed on to the scheduler.
  Currently, the only scheduler option is:

  * :num-threads Specifies the number of worker threads for the scheduler's
                 thread pool [5]

  The scheduler options also define which scheduler to use, so if you
  don't pass any with a `schedule` call, you'll get the default
  scheduler configured with the default options. If you pass scheduler
  options on a subsequent call, you will get a different scheduler
  configured with those options. The same scheduler will be used for any
  future `schedule` calls with those same scheduler options.

  If you need to capture any bindings in effect when the job is
  scheduled, wrap `f` in a call to `bound-fn`."
